## Hello, World! I'm Oscar, welcome to my GitHub

#### About Me
I'm a self-taught programmer, who has been programming for fun
since I was 12 years old as well as having taken a truly fascinating and edifying
CS course in High School.

Programming has always been one of my favorite and powerful tools. Whether it
be programming a visual implementation of Lorentz and Galilean transformations
for a physics project on Special Relativity, brute-forcing difficult probability questions
in math or just CS class projects, it has always been a joy to work with and enhanced
my learning.

#### Languages

I started out with Python, but since then I've branched into
anything else, that might have been useful for any projects
I might've thought of. I consider myself reasonably fluent and have made at least a part of a project in the following languages:

* Python (including Flask framework)
* JavaScript
* C
* PHP
* SQL (either through sqlite3 or MySQL)
* HTML
* CSS (and Bootstrap framework)

#### Online Courses

I've only engaged with programming on a hobby-level to aid me with my other interests
, so I don't have any qualifications beyond some online courses including

* Harvard's CS50 through EdX
* Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate

You will probably not find much beyond hobby-level projects on this GitHub,
but if anything might be of use to you, feel free to stick around and copy it.
